I am a lecturer in the School of Information Technology, Deakin University (Burwood campus). I am also an honorary fellow in the School of Computing and Information Systems (CIS), The University of Melbourne. Before joining Deakin, I was a research fellow in the Schoolf of CIS, The University of Melbourne, where I obtained my PhD degree in machine learning in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">James Bailey</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MjgOHPYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Sudanthi Wijewickrema</a>. I received my Master and Bacholor degrees from Tsinghua University and Jilin University respectively.

I have a broad interest in the theory and applications of machine learning and deep learning, especially adversarial machine learning and the security/privacy aspects of AI systems. 
<span style="color:rgb(19,0,238)">I am open to collaborations and partnerships. </span>

<!-- I have visited a few amazing research institues: National Institute of Informatics (Japan) hosted by Prof. Michael E. Houle, and RIKEN (Japan) hosted by Prof. Masashi Sugiyama. I am also fortunate to have collabarated with many highly respected researchers. -->
